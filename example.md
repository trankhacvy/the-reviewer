 **Syntax and logical errors**:
- There are no syntax or logical errors in the provided code snippet.

**Code refactoring and quality**:
- Move the inline comments explaining the purpose of the code to a comment block at the top of the file for better organization and readability.
- Remove the commented-out code that is not needed, as it can create confusion and clutter.
- Consolidate the meta tags related to the webpage description and theme color into a separate component/file for better modularity and maintainability.

**Performance optimization**:
- Since this code is an HTML template, there are no specific performance optimization techniques to apply. However, it's always a good practice to minify HTML files to reduce their size for faster page load times.

**Security vulnerabilities**:
- There are no security vulnerabilities in the provided code snippet. However, it's important to ensure that any dynamic values included in this template (e.g., from a backend server) are properly escaped to prevent XSS attacks.

**Best practices**:
- Update the language attribute in the HTML tag to specify the actual language code, such as `"en-US"`, instead of `"en"`.
- Remove the unused comments or code to keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
- Use self-closing tags for empty HTML elements, such as the `link` and `meta` tags, to improve readability and consistency. For example, instead of `<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" />`, use `<link rel="icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">`. 


## assignment-2/src/App.css 

 **Syntax and logical errors**:
- No syntax or logical errors found. Code is well-formatted.

**Code refactoring and quality**:
- Extract common colors used in the code into variables/constants to improve readability and maintainability. For example:
  - Replace `#35434c` with a variable like `$text-color`.
  - Replace `#d2445d` with a variable like `$primary-color`.
- Consolidate similar media queries into a single one to reduce duplicate code. For example:
  - Instead of having three separate media queries for `screen and (max-width: 750px)`, `screen and (max-width: 300px)`, and `screen and (max-width: 170px)`, combine them into a single media query with multiple conditions.
- Remove unused styles and classes to reduce clutter and improve code maintainability. For example:
  - Remove the `.responsive-btn` class since it is not used anywhere in the code.
  - Remove the `.theme-toggle` class since it is not used anywhere in the code.

**Performance optimization**:
- Use minified CSS to reduce the file size and improve load times.
- Minify and compress images used in the code to reduce their file sizes and improve page load performance.
- Combine multiple CSS files into a single file and leverage browser caching to reduce the number of HTTP requests and improve page load speed.

**Security vulnerabilities**:
- Ensure that user input is properly validated and sanitized before using it in any SQL queries or database operations to prevent SQL injection attacks. This is not applicable to the provided CSS code, as it does not interact with any user input or databases.

**Best practices**:
- Use meaningful and descriptive class names to improve code readability and maintainability. For example, instead of `.header-container`, consider using a more specific name like `.main-header`.
- Organize CSS rules by grouping related styles together and separating them with comments to improve code readability and maintainability. For example, group all header-related styles together and separate them from table styles with comments.
- Avoid using unnecessary comments or comments that state the obvious. Keep comments concise and focus on explaining complex logic or providing context when necessary.

## assignment-2/src/BookTable.js 

 **Syntax and logical errors**:
- No syntax or logical errors found in the code snippet provided.
- The code has correct indentation and there are no missing or mismatched parentheses or brackets.

**Code refactoring and quality**:
- Use destructuring for the `book` variable in the map function to improve code readability:

  Before:
  ```javascript
  bookData.map((book) => { ... })
  ```

  After:
  ```javascript
  bookData.map(({ id, name, author, topic }) => { ... })
  ```

- Add a keyExtractor function to extract the unique key for each book in the map function. This ensures each book has a unique key and improves rendering performance:

  Before:
  ```javascript
  bookData.map((book) => { ... })
  ```

  After:
  ```javascript
  bookData.map((book) => <tr key={book.id}> ... </tr>)
  ```

- Move the onClick logic for the Delete button to a separate function for better code organization and reusability:

  Before:
  ```javascript
  <button className="btn" onClick={() => {
    setOpenDeleteBookPopup(true);
    setSelectedBook(book);
  }}>Delete</button>
  ```

  After:
  ```javascript
  const handleDeleteButtonClick = (book) => {
    setOpenDeleteBookPopup(true);
    setSelectedBook(book);
  }

  ...

  <button className="btn" onClick={() => handleDeleteButtonClick(book)}>Delete</button>
  ```

**Performance optimization**:
- No performance optimizations are necessary for the given code snippet. It already avoids unnecessary re-renders by using the book's unique `id` as the key for each row in the table.

**Security vulnerabilities**:
- No security vulnerabilities found in the code snippet. However, it's important to ensure that the `bookData` coming from the context is properly authenticated and authorized before displaying it in the table.

**Best practices**:
- Add comments at the beginning of the component to provide a brief overview of its purpose and functionality.
- Use intuitive variable and function names. For example, consider renaming `setSelectedBook` to `handleBookSelection` or `handleSelectBook` for better clarity and consistency.
- Follow consistent casing for JSX component names and HTML tags. In this code snippet, the table should be written as `<table id="books-table">` instead of `</table>`. 


## assignment-2/src/Context.js 

 **Syntax and logical errors**:
- No syntax or logical errors found in the code snippet.

**Code refactoring and quality**:
- The code snippet uses multiple context APIs to manage state in React. This can make the code more complex and harder to maintain. Consider using a state management library like Redux or MobX to centralize and simplify state management.
- Instead of exporting each context individually, you can export them as an object for better organization and readability:
```javascript
export const Contexts = {
  OpenAddBookPopup: React.createContext(),
  ListVisibleBooks: React.createContext(),
  OpenDeleteBookPopup: React.createContext(),
  Pagination: React.createContext(),
  Search: React.createContext(),
  Theme: React.createContext(),
}
```
- Consider using more descriptive names for the context variables to improve clarity and understandability.

**Performance optimization**:
- No performance optimization suggestions for this code snippet.

      const searchTerm = e.target.value;
      await setSearchTerm(searchTerm);

      const pagination = createDefaultPagination();
      const { data, totalBooks } = searchBooks(pagination, searchTerm);

      setBookData(data);
      updatePaginationInfo(pagination, totalBooks);
      storePaginationConfigToLocalStorage(pagination);
    }
    ```
- Move the imports inside the component to improve organization and readability.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    import React, { useContext } from 'react';

    import {
      ListVisibleBooksContext,
      OpenAddBookPopupContext,
      PaginationContext,
      SearchContext,
    } from './Context';
    import {
      getBooksByPage,
      storePaginationConfigToLocalStorage,
    } from './Utils';
    ```
- Consider using destructuring assignment to extract the required values from the context objects to make the code more concise.
  - Example:
    ```javascript
    const { setOpenAddBookPopup } = useContext(OpenAddBookPopupContext);
    const { setBookData } = useContext(ListVisibleBooksContext);
    const { paginationInfo, setPaginationInfo } = useContext(PaginationContext);
    const { setSearchTerm } = useContext(SearchContext);
    ```

} from './Utils';

// Separate component for the delete book form
const DeleteBookForm = ({ selectedBook, handleSubmit, handleCancel }) => {
  return (
    <form action="" className="form-container" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <h2>Delete Book</h2>
      <p id="delete-book-msg">
        Are you sure you want to delete this <b>{selectedBook.name}</b> book?
      </p>
      <div className="btn-group-delete">
        <button type="submit" className="btn" id="delete-book-btn">
          Delete
        </button>
        <button
          type="button"

- Inconsistent indentation of CSS properties, e.g., some are indented with 2 spaces and some with 4 spaces
- Missing semicolons at the end of CSS property values

**Code Readability**:
- Avoid excessive shorthand property values when not necessary, e.g., `'Segoe UI', 'Roboto', 'Oxygen'`
- Consider grouping related CSS properties together, e.g., all font-related properties in one block, all text-related properties in another block

**Best Practices**:
- Use consistent and standardized naming conventions for CSS classes and IDs
- Minify or compress CSS for production to improve performance and reduce file size
- Consider using a CSS preprocessor like SASS or LESS to improve code organization and maintainability 


## assignment-2/src/index.js

**Code refactoring and quality**:
* Remove unnecessary imports: The code imports `reportWebVitals` module but does not use it in the code. It can be safely removed to improve code cleanliness.
* Use import statement with 'react-dom' instead of 'react-dom/client': The code imports `ReactDOM` using `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'`. It is recommended to use `import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'` instead for better readability and consistency.
* Avoid unnecessary comments: The code includes a comment about measuring performance with `reportWebVitals`, but it is not necessary since the code does not actually include that functionality. It can be safely removed to avoid confusion.

**Performance optimization**:
* No specific recommendations for performance optimization in this code snippet.

**Security vulnerabilities**:
* No specific security vulnerabilities in this code snippet. It does not deal with user input or sensitive data.

**Best practices**:
* Use consistent import statements: The code mixes import statements using `import X from 'package'` and `import Y from 'package/module'` formats. It is recommended to use the same format throughout the code for consistency.
* Remove unused code: The code imports `index.css` but it is not used in the code. It is recommended to remove unused imports to improve code cleanliness and reduce potential confusion.
* Remove unnecessary comments: The code includes a comment about starting performance measurement with `reportWebVitals`, but since the code does not actually include that functionality, the comment is unnecessary and can be removed to improve code readability.
